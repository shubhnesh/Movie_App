# Flutter MovieApp

It is a clean and simple Flutter application that lets you browse movies and TV shows using data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

This app is designed to give users a smooth and engaging experience while exploring:
- Trending Movies
- Top-Rated Movies
- Popular TV Shows

---

### Home Screen Highlights

The Home screen is split into three sections:

1. **Trending Movies**
2. **Top Rated Movies**
3. **Popular TV Shows**

Each section shows a quick preview — just **10 items** from each category — to keep things clean and fast.

👉 Want to see more? Just tap the **“See All”** button, which is to the right of any section!

### Explore More with "See All"

When you tap on the **“See All”** button in any section:
- You’re taken to a full-screen list of **all movies/TV shows** in that category.
- The **App Bar title** changes based on what you tap.

For example:
- If you clicked from "Trending Movies", the AppBar will show: **"All Trending Movies"**
- And if you clicked from "Top Rated Movies", it would say: **"All Top Rated Movies"**
- And so on…
